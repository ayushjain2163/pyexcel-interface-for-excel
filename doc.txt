To convert data from an Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the `pandas` library, which integrates seamlessly with `openpyxl` for reading Excel files.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Pandas and OpenPyXL** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

2. **Read Excel Data into a DataFrame**:
   Use `pandas.read_excel()` to load the Excel file into a DataFrame. By default, it reads the first sheet of the Excel file.

### Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from Excel into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_excel('example.xlsx', engine='openpyxl')

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
```

### Explanation:
- `pd.read_excel('example.xlsx', engine='openpyxl')` reads the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- `engine='openpyxl'` ensures that `openpyxl` is used as the backend to read `.xlsx` files (you can omit this if Pandas automatically detects it).

### Additional Options:
You can specify more options to customize the import, such as:
- **Sheet Name**: If you want to read a specific sheet, use the `sheet_name` parameter.
  ```python
  df = pd.read_excel('example.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1', engine='openpyxl')
  ```

- **Skip Rows**: To skip the first few rows of the sheet:
  ```python
  df = pd.read_excel('example.xlsx', skiprows=2, engine='openpyxl')
  ```

- **Read Multiple Sheets**: If you want to read multiple sheets into a dictionary of DataFrames:
  ```python
  all_sheets_df = pd.read_excel('example.xlsx', sheet_name=None, engine='openpyxl')
  print(all_sheets_df)  # This will give you a dictionary with sheet names as keys
  ```

### Handling Specific Columns:

If you want to read only specific columns from an Excel sheet, you can use the `usecols` parameter:
```python
df = pd.read_excel('example.xlsx', usecols=["A", "C", "E"], engine='openpyxl')
```

This reads only columns A, C, and E from the sheet into the DataFrame.

### Converting Excel Data to DataFrame:
Once the data is loaded into a DataFrame, you can manipulate it just like any other DataFrame in Pandas. You can filter rows, modify columns, perform statistical operations, and more.

### Example Output:
If you had an Excel sheet with the following content:

| Name  | Age | City       |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Alice | 30  | New York   |
| Bob   | 25  | San Francisco |
| Charlie | 35 | Los Angeles |

After reading it into a DataFrame, the `df` would look like this:

```
      Name  Age           City
0    Alice   30       New York
1      Bob   25  San Francisco
2  Charlie   35    Los Angeles
```
